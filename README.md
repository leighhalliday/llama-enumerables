# Welcome to the Llama Farm!

## To get it running:
- Clone this repo to your computer.
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `rspec llama_farm_spec.rb`

## What's inside here?
- data.rb: Take a look at the data... which llamas are in the Llama Farm
- llama.rb: This is a Llama... it has a name, age, food (fav), spitter (boolean)
- llama_farm.rb: A collection of llamas with methods to complete
- llama_farm_finished.rb: An already completed llama farm... don't cheat.
- llama_farm_spec.rb: The tests for our llama farm. Get these to pass!

## The goal
The goal is to get all of the tests passing in the llama_farm_spec.rb file.
You will have to implement the methods in the llama_farm.rb file which are empty.
